### Hello!

My name is Elliot Nelson, and I'm a full-time remote software engineer.

Most of my desk time is spent cranking out code for my day job, but I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects, especially CLI-related projects like:

- [sywac](https://github.com/sywac/sywac)
- [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts)
- [jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)
- and more!

I also enjoy tinkering with javascript games, usually during [js13k](http://js13kgames.com/) every August -- you can see some of my past projects below.
